# Why I decided to take this course

I've been doing software development project courses at university before and in most of them the focus was very clearly on either the development process (i.e. learning _how_ to code something) or the surrounding project work aspects (like learning about the agile method, working in a software development team or something similar) and even if there would have been some aspect of building e.g. CI/CD pipelines or other DevOps related activities, they weren't interesting to me at that point in time. However now they've become relevant in my professional career and as such I figured to take this course to get a good intro alongside personal extracurricular studies regarding DevOps.  

What I've noticed more recently though is that it is more and more crucial to be able to setup quick MVP apps and pages especially in consulting work to be able to show the client quickly a high-level model of what you're aiming to deliver. I've also done a lot of personal projects in varying scale and usually hosted them either in Heroku, a DigitalOcean droplet, Netlify or a similar service. However, they all require quite a lot setting up in varying levels of complexity and GitHub Pages seems a lot easier to handle (and I can fit all my projects under my own personal *.github.io -domain!). In that sense, learning how to use these lightweight platforms such as GitHub Pages was not necessarily what I signed up for, but a very nice addition to the reasons why. I was initially planning on doing the advanced project, but I didn't really have enough time to implement it after all. I do plan on trying to do it myself later on, though!  

# Things I learned

Before the course I had a vague understanding of what DevOps means on a very high level. I definitely do think that I got a better view into what it actually is and what kinds of activities it can contain. In addition I feel like I now have a very much better grasp on what continuous practices (continuous integration, continuous delivery and continuous deployment) are and how they differ from each other. Before I've just blindly used some CI and CD services in work projects without actually understanding what they do as someone else's responsibility has been to implement and maintain those pipelines. Now I feel like I can actually contribute to discussions regarding those and some DevOps activities.  

During this project I learned lots of new things about GitHub Pages. I've used it once before but it was a long time ago and even then I didn't setup the system myself. I was surprised how easy it was- it was literally a couple clicks and you're up and running! I was also positively surprised about how quick the redeployments are after changes. I wonder how expensive it actually is to manage such a snappy infrastructural solution and to provide it for your customers for free...  

In an interesting turn of events, the course actually also piqued my interest a bit deeper into the world of DevOps, and I've now been considering studying a bit more of the processes and models related to it during the few free weeks under Christmas and New Year. I was initially a bit worried how well a one credit course could deliver information about such a large topic but at least in my case it was a good starting point.
